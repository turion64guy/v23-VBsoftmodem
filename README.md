v23-VBsoftmodem  
#VBnet V23 Softmodem  
Experimental V23 softmodem written in Visual Basic .net.  

The end goal is to write a software modem for Minitel terminals.  
They use ITU-T V.23 modems (1200bits/s downlink, 75bits/s uplink), and the latests ones (ie: Magis Club) support V.27 (4800bit/s) and V.29 (9600bit/s).  
**This Visual Basic-based modem project is mostly an experiment to see if I'm able to write such a softmodem.**  
Once I have a working proof of concept, I'll see what I do with it. I already have some ideas. But I'll probably end up re-writing the code in C.  

Please note that I'm really bad at math, so don't be surprised if the DSP code is really retarded...
